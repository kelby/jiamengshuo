            <p>Wow, guys. Lots of great feedback.</p>
            <p>First, <a href="#">@Milkmusket</a>, I agree. I've struggled with that section and might take advice for <a href="#">@albanesetr</a> and focus on a single feature rather than the whole screenshot.</p>
            <p><a>@Hans</a>, I usually try to go for drop shadows pumped with a little color, may not be the case here but thanks for the comment. And for the header noise, and noise overall in the site, I need to try reducing it all around before we go live.</p>
            <p><a>@albanesetr</a>, thanks for all the good feedback. The pricing plans are definitely still WIP, the yellow $150 should have a "Most Popular" header, you're right. Other mockups had it, not sure why I haven't put it up yet.</p>
            <p>I'll try reducing the header, the active state was just conceptual at this point. For the one shown, I was considering a fixed header and wanted the user to see where they were at when scrolling. So the thick yellow bar would slide when you scroll.</p>
            <p>Again, thanks everyone. I really enjoy the feedback on Forrst. Much more in depth than over at Dribbble. :P</p>

        <p>So after a year and a half i have decided to redesign my portfolio, all images on these are placeholders, I also still have some ideas i have yet to add.</p>

        <p>Also a question for you guys, do you ever start to dislike your design after a while even though you loved it initially, because that's happening to me right now. I don't know what it is about this design, but I get annoyed when I look at it. Naturally I don't want others to feel that way when they visit my portfolio</p>

        <p>Awesome. Always like to see illustrated characters. Some quick pieces of feedback:</p>

        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>The body positioning looks a bit unnatural, especially for the female character. Her hips and bossom should be aligned at the angle her body is turned.</li>
          <li>The arms are a bit too long and have an unnatural bend at the elbows.</li>
          <li>The fingers don't seem to be grasping the phones. They seem to sit on the palm.</li>
